# Miscellaneous

## Travel
I'm passionate about travel, having explored nine countries. As I embark on my journey as a PhD candidate, I look forward to attending conferences in various places and exploring more countries to further enrich my experiences. Below is a footprint of myself. 

Acknowledgement: thanks for Prof. Xiao Lei and Prof. Zizhuo Wang providing the insights.
