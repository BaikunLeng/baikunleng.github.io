## Travel
I have a deep passion for traveling, embracing the beauty of different landscapes. Up to this point, I've had the opportunity to travel or live in nine countries. As I embark on my journey as a PhD candidate, I look forward to attending conferences in various places and exploring more countries to further enrich my experiences. Below is a footprint of myself.

## Photography
Iâ€™m constantly studying and improving my photography skills. Below is a sample of my work from my Instagram. They are from Banff in Canada, Dream Lake in USA, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and Quarry Bay in Hong Kong.
