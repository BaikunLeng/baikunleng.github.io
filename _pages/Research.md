  Proposed and optimized firms’ policies (investment; production; pollution abatement) in the carbon market by formulating a two-stage problem in which firms are free to choose investment/no investment (resulting in high/low abatement ability) with a cost K in Stage I and then decide their own optimal production quantity, pollution abatement level with the aim of maximizing whole process profits under the constrain of pollution regulation in stage II. 
  Discovered and proved that the equilibrium solutions for production quantity, carbon abatement ratio, and trading volume of each firm—as presented in Anand (2020)—remain unaffected by our extension from a one-stage model to a two-stage model. This consistency holds true across variations in emission cap (S), the number of regulated firms (n), and the number of firms with high abatement capability (m).
  Utilized the concept of Nash equilibrium to delineate Stage I investment equilibrium boundaries for n firms as functions of decision variables S and K. By plotting these (K, S) boundary curves, the space is partitioned into distinct regions, each indicating a specific equilibrium strategy. This visualization illustrates how equilibrium outcomes shift with variations in S and K.
  Initiated the study with a basic 2-firm model, employing Python to conduct numerical tests that affirm the stability of our decision equilibrium boundaries. When extending to 3 and more firms, analytical solutions for boundary intersections proved challenging. Resorted to Mathematica for these numerical evaluations, revealing a hypothesized rapid convergence towards asymptotic behaviors as firm numbers increase.
