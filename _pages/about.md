About 
======
Welcome! My name is Baikun (Leon) Leng. I'm a senior undergraduate in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). Additionally, I spent my junior year as a visiting student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I'm a forthcoming Ph.D. Student in UW Seattle ISOM Department.

I am passionate about exploring a wide array of research directions and emerging topics during my undergraduates period. Throughout my undergraduate studies, my primary research interests have been in Operations Interface and Market Design. I aim to address operational challenges that arise in business and society.
