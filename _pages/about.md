About 
======
Welcome! My name is Baikun (Leon) Leng. I'm a senior undergraduate in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). Additionally, I spent my junior year as a visiting student in [the Department of IEOR](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). 

I am passionate about exploring a wide array of research directions and emerging topics during my undergraduates period. Throughout my undergraduate studies, my primary research interests have been in Operations Interface and Market Design. I aim to address operational challenges that arise in business and society using tools from analytical modeling & optimization and data-driven methods such as online learning and more. 

I'm currently working on (i) Online Learning under Markov Choice Model with Network Effects supervised by [Haixiang Lan](https://ieor.columbia.edu/content/haixiang-lan), [Prof. Zizhuo Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangzizhuo/), [Prof. Guillermo Gallego](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FK7w8QIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof.Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/), and (ii) Fairness in Blockchain Adoption Insurance with [Prof. Rowena Gan](https://www.smu.edu/cox/Our-People-and-Community/Faculty/Rowena-J-Gan). 

Beyond my academic journey, I also have a year experience of investment analyst at blockchain industry at [Nothing Research](https://www.nothing-research.com/); [Meridian Capital](http://www.meridiancapital.com.cn/en/index.aspx) and half year experience of data anayst at [US Arctic Research Commission](https://www.arctic.gov/) and [Berkeley Haas](https://haas.berkeley.edu/).

[Ph.D. Application Handbook(In Chinese)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RF0mcGvfjqQJ6jKxQSdKGBON6v0lgKkH/view?usp=sharing) This work, I got insights from lots of people, [Haixiang Lan](https://ieor.columbia.edu/content/haixiang-lan), Prof. [Renyu Zhang](https://rphilipzhang.github.io/rphilipzhang/) and so on.
