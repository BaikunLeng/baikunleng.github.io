About 
======
Welcome! My name is Baikun (Leon) Leng. I'm a Ph.D. student in the [ISOM Department at the University of Washington, Seattle](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/academic-departments/information-systems-and-operations-management/). I completed my undergraduate studies at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). During my junior year, I was a visiting student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). 

I am passionate about exploring a wide array of emerging topics. Throughout my undergraduate studies, my primary research interests have been in Operations Interface and Market Design. I aim to address operational challenges that arise in business and society. [Special Thanks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgV9CTCBdbvIVUikvdCwGaxfAh6RPsVJR44k_E-LcNc/edit)<br>
